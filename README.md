# Cipher

Alphabet Key: A = 0, B = 1, C = 2,.....

Hill Cipher Encryption Performed.  Key matrix and encryption phrase is inputted into Constructor.

Encryption:
Phrase is converted to Key numeric values and encrypted using dot product of key matrix.  Modular Multiplaction is also incorporated in dot product.
Encrypted phrase and Encrypted Array are created

Decryption:
Encrypted Array is decrypted using the same key matrix.  Modular Multiplicative inverse is used on the key matrix to decrypt the encrypted message and 
get the original message back
